# MPDRx-Navigation
 
MPDRx-Navigation is built as a complement to NativeKontrol's MPDRx.

MPDRx Melodic adds functionality to use a 16 pad controller to perform melodic or harmonic content.

It requires that the pads send MIDI notes 48 to 63.

The Root Pad section sets on which pad the root key will be located. Around this pad is where the rest of the notes in the scale will be arranged. With the Scale section you can select the Root Key and kind of scale you want to use. The Octave knob transposes your input notes by octaves, and the Vel Min and Vel Max set the minimum and maximum velocity your controller sends, letting you modify the sensibility of your controller.
